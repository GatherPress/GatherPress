# Custom URL Endpoints

GatherPress provides some different and custom URL endpoints, for example `/ical` and `/feed/ical`.

**Existing custom endpoints:**

- `example.org/event/my-sample-event/ical`

   provides a download-able .ics file in ical format.

- `example.org/event/my-sample-event/outlook`

   provides the same download-able file as an alias.

- `example.org/event/my-sample-event/google-calendar`

   redirects to create a new event in *Google Calendar*.

- `example.org/event/my-sample-event/yahoo-calendar`

   redirects to create a new event in *Yahoo Calendar*.

- `example.org/event/feed/ical`

   provides a subscribe-able event feed in xcal format with all events of the site.

- `example.org/venue/my-sample-venue/feed/ical`

   provides a subscribe-able event feed in xcal format with all events at that venue.

- `example.org/topic/my-sample-topic/feed/ical`

   provides a subscribe-able event feed in xcal format with all events grouped into that topic.

The most obvious functions to create such within WordPress seem to be [`add_feed()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_feed/) and [`add_rewrite_endpoint()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_rewrite_endpoint/) for this purpose.

Unfortunately both functions share a common pitfall, they are not restricitive to any post type at all. That would result in having a `/feed/ical` endpoint for all posts AND every other non-hierachical, custom post type which seemed to be the wrong way to go. A lot of code would have had to be written, to patch this behavior and remove those superflous endpoints.

That's why GatherPress created its own Endpoint ~~API~~ helper and tries to fix the mentioned problems before they appear.

## GatherPress' own Endpoint API

In opposite to the former mentioned WordPress core functions GatherPress Endpoint API is flexible enough to not *only* provide endpoints for GatherPress. You can utilize its classes to create a plenty of different endpoints for your post types and taxonomies as well.

In general, one endpoint can be created ...

- for individual posts
- for post type archives
- for taxonomy archives

It can be either ...

- a redirect 

  *or*

- a template to load


### Setup new endpoints

To create a new endpoint you will want to create a new instance of the *pure* [`Endpoint()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-endpoint.php) class or one of its sub-classes:

- [`Posttype_Single_Endpoint()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-posttype-single-endpoint.php)

   for endpoints like `example.org/cpt/my-custom-post-type/new-endpoint`

- [`Posttype_Single_Feed_Endpoint()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-posttype-single-feed-endpoint.php)

   for endpoints like `example.org/cpt/my-custom-post-type/feed/new-endpoint`

- [`Posttype_Feed_Endpoint()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-posttype-feed-endpoint.php)

   for endpoints like `example.org/cpt/feed/new-endpoint`

- [`Taxonomy_Feed_Endpoint()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-taxonomy-feed-endpoint.php)

   for endpoints like `example.org/ctax/feed/new-endpoint`

These classes help to select *where* an endpoint should run.

To become properly callable as URL, the endpoints needs to know *what* to do when some URL is requested. Therefore each `Endpoint()` needs to have at least one of either:

- [`Endpoint_Redirect()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-endpoint-redirect.php)

  *or*

- [`Endpoint_Template()`](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/tree/main/includes/core/classes/endpoints/class-endpoint-template.php)

## Example 1 | Add events to *Office365 Calendar*

Example for a new redirection endpoint like `example.org/event/my-sample-event/office365-calendar`

### 1. Setup new endpoint

```php
new Posttype_Single_Endpoint(
	array(
		new Endpoint_Redirect(
			'office365-calendar',
			array( $this, 'get_redirect_to' )
		),
	),
	'gatherpress_awesome_calendar',
);
```

> [!TIP]
> Run this on the `registered_post_type_{post_type}` action, to ensure that custom endpoints are registered after their post type is initialized. GatherPress will trigger php WARNINGs if called too early or or with unsupported arguments.

### 2. Define the endpoints callback



### 3. Use & retrieve endpoints

To use the newly created endpoints, you can use `Endpoints::get_url()` and rely on WordPress core functions accordingly:

- `Endpoints::get_url( 'office365-calendar' )`
