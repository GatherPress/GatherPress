## Description

GatherPress, a plugin created by and for the WordPress community, is a response to the community's desire for novel event management tools that meet the diverse needs of event organizers and members. Its agenda and roadmap align with that of the WordPress community, ensuring that it evolves in tandem with our collective wants and needs.

**We propose a pilot program to test GatherPress, a community-developed plugin, within interested and active WordPress meetup groups. This initiative stems from our communityâ€™s need for an innovative event management tool tailored to the unique demands of WordPress event organizers and participants.**

This project is for the collaborative effort to build a compelling event management application using open source tools such as _WordPress_ and _BuddyPress_ and the grit sweat and love of **the community, for the community**.

We're creating the very network features we need to host events and gather well.

### Features

- Event Scheduling: set dates, times, and provide event information details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What external services are used in GatherPress?

We utilize Open Street Maps to render meeting locations in a map form. In order to do so we send the address to OSM in order to render their map.

### Configure GatherPress

In WP Admin, go to `Events`  > `Settings`.

You can change different settings such as:
- Show publish date as event date for events.
- The default maximum limit of attendees to an event.
- Anonymous RSVP.
- Date Format.
- Time Format.
- Display the timezone for scheduled events.
- Upcoming Events page.
- Past Events page.

### Create an Event

In WP Admin, go to `Events` > `Add New`.

By default, a few blocks are populated, you can keep them or delete them and you can add more blocks.

- The Event date block allows you to define the start and end dates and times of your event, as well as the timezone.
- The Add to Calendar block enables your users to add the event to their preferred calendar directly from the published event on the frontend.
- The Venue block lets you choose whether your event is online or in a venue. You can select the venue (refer to point 4) and the map settings: display, zoom level, type of map and map height.
- The RSVP block enables members to confirm they attend or do not attend an event.
- The description of the event is a normal paragraph block. You can add anything with any block here.
- The RSVP Response block displays a list of members who have confirmed they attend or do not attend an event.
- The event settings allow you to modify all the above mentioned settings, enable or disable anonymous RSVP, choose Topics, notify members or attendees, as well as standard WordPress settings such as the featured image, the excerpt, allow or disallow comments, etc.

### Create a Venue

In WP Admin, go to `Events` > `Venues`.

In the Venue block, you can define:
- The full address, telephone, and website of the venue.
- The map settings.

### Create an Event Topic

Topics are like post categories, but for events.
